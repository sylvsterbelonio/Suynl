    <p class=" j">
        <b>Repentance implies a change in direction, "turning away from sin" toward "changing one's mind" to live for God.</b> 
        It begins with a decision to turn from sin and surrender to the lordship of Jesus Christ. 
        And it's vitally necessary for anyone desiring to draw near to the Lord and walk with Him every day. 
        Repentance is much more than just acknowledging wrongdoing. 
        It is a change of mind and heart that gives us a fresh view about God, about us, and about the world. 
        It includes turning away from sin and turning to God for forgiveness. 
        It is motivated by love for God and the sincere desire to obey His commandments.
    </p>
    
    <p class=" j">
        Our sin, however, is not the end of the story. In fact, God works through everything that happens in our lives, including our sin, to draw us to Jesus

        <b>Find Faith to Repent!</b><br>
        If you have been struggling with a sin that entangles, repentance may seem like a difficult thing. But consider that the Bible says 
        <i class="highlight-verse">"the kindness of God leads you to repentance"</i> <b class="text-light-primary">(Romans 2:4).</b> 
        <i class="highlight-verse">Another verse lets us know that God is patiently waiting for us to repent</i> <b class="text-light-primary">(2 Peter 3:9).</b>
     </p>
     
     <p class=" j">
        Your heavenly Father is not looking for ways to punish you. Yes, God is just, but He is also a loving Father searching for the lost coin or the one lost sheep - willing to leave 99 in the safe pasture to find the one that has gone astray.
     </p>        
     
      <p class=" j">
       One of the most powerful portraits of God's love can be seen in the parable of the prodigal son. After the son changed his mind and headed home, the Bible says, 
       <i class="highlight-verse">"while he was still a long way off, his father saw him, and ran and embraced him, and kissed him"</i> <b class="text-light-primary">(Luke 15:20).</b> 
       This is God's heart toward you when you come to Him in repentance.

      </p>
      
      <p class=" j">
      <b>As You Pray</b>, God is patiently waiting with open arms for His sons and daughters to come home. All it takes is humility on our part and faith to believe that a loving Father will hear our honest pleas and cleanse us of our sin.
      </p>
      
      <p class=" j">
       <b>Take a moment right now to repent</b> -- to change your mind and turn from whatever is separating you from God and those around you.
      </p>
      
      <p class=" j">
       <i>"Father, I believe You love me. Your Word says that it is your patience and kindness that lead me to repentance. So I come to You humbly and confess my sins. I thank you for forgiving and cleansing my body, soul and spirit. By the blood of Jesus, teach me how to walk honestly and with righteousness before You every day. In Jesus' name. Amen.
        We must trust Jesus Christ to forgive our sins and determine to obey Him for the rest of our lives. That way we can know God and find peace again.</i>
      </p>
      
      <p class=" j">
      The Bible says, <i class="highlight-verse">"So you will be saved, if you honestly say, Jesus is Lord, and if you believe with all your heart that 
      God raised Him from death. God will accept you and save you, if you truly believe this."</i> <b class="text-light-primary">(Romans 10:9-10)</b>

        Identify your hidden sins that control your life and distance you from God. Repent and ask the Lord for His forgiveness so that you can have a new beginning. It doesn't matter if we failed in the past; we can start all over again at any time. What commitments is God calling you to make with Him today?
        Think of anything; thoughts, situations, or actions that can become hindrances in your relationship with God.
